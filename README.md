# Project Overview

LabuLand is an innovative "Figital" (physical + digital) project that breathes life into Labubu dolls through the integration of NFC  and blockchain. By placing a physical NFC card on a Labubu doll, users can bring their dolls to life on the blockchain, creating a unique on-chain identity for each Labubu.

Key Features

1. On-Chain Identity: Each Labubu doll is equipped with an NFC card that, when activated, registers the doll on the blockchain, giving it a unique digital presence.

2. Collective World: New Labubu users are welcomed into an expansive on-chain world where they can interact with other Labubu owners. This shared digital space allows users to view and engage with each other's Labubus, fostering a sense of community.

3. Breeding Mechanism: NFT holders have the exciting opportunity to "mate" their Labubus with others, resulting in the creation of new, unique Labubu NFTs. This feature encourages collaboration and interaction among users.

4. NFT holders: tax is collected from trading platform token called $LABU. and the tax is distributed equally among NFT holders
